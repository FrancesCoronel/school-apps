# NYU

I've set my heart and soul to pursuing a career in the startup tech scene just because every time I learn something new within the field, I feel like a child again (it's a wonderful feeling). The constant change I'll have to go through also resonates well with me since I don't like to focus on the same thing for too long and I'll never be able to claim I'm an expert for too long.

My prior academic history will tell you I've always tried to pursue typical life events at an earlier age and am constantly trying to involve myself with the non-familiar. I entered primary school earlier, took numerous college classes through dual enrollment all throughout high school starting at the age of 13, ended up graduating high school at the top of my class at an age younger than the majority and now intend to receive my master's by the age of 21. For me, it's never been the rush, but the thrill of the experiences I've gone through that have compelled me to be crazy enough to seek them out time and time again.

Even now, I'm juggling a part time job with a top software consulting firm in my local area while taking a full load of five classes my last semester of senior year. I've already won scholarships/the opportunity to attend several major league hackathons like TreeHacks at Stanford and famous tech conferences like React.js Conf and DeveloperWeek in San Francisco (to name a few) throughout this semester. For the first time, I was the speaker for a tech conference this past November and have two more events lined up where I'll be speaking about my experience with JS (JavaScript) coding bootcamps and how to get started as a developer. All this while I still try to build and design upon smaller side projects from time to time.

This sort of schedule wasn't hacked out spontaneously. It took a while to build up my online reputation and technical skills to get this far. It also took a while to get over the initial fear of feeling as though I represent my entire race and gender every time I speak up at these tech events due to the general lack of diversity. But as I mentioned earlier, being uncomfortable can excite me in a way I still don't entirely understand myself.

The reason I'm applying to NYU's MOT program is because I'm not ready to stop learning (to put it simply). While attending Fullstack Academy this past summer, I realized I wanted to attend a program that would provide the same experience Fullstack provided â€” a very immersive learning program that was designed for high-impact and speed. In other words, I'm excited to get into the workplace but I recognize the importance of having the experience of having a high-value master's program that integrates both business and technology beforehand. Ideally, with the skills I'll learn through the program, I too will be able to inspire others in the tech scene and show them that yes, Latinas can indeed code and lead within the tech industry. In any industry, really.

The opportunity to join the NYU community would be quite amazing. Since the curriculum focuses on practical real-life applications in the tech industry, I know my time will be well-spent. And that's what really matters to me.
