Here, I weirdly display all the essays I used for my undergrad and grad school applications!

## Undergrad

I got wait listed or rejected by most of the schools I applied to (20 or so). 💀

At some time between, I decided to apply to [UofPeople](http://www.uopeople.edu/) cause I watched a TED talk about it but then after I got accepted and tried out the actual platform, I found it kinda wasn't for me. 💀

## Grad School

Then, 3 years later, there was a 180, and I got accepted to all the grad schools I applied to (10).

Not too surprising since grad school acceptance rates are usually a lot less competitive but it was still nice.

You'll notice that I basically used the same base template for all of them with a few changes.

**Computer Science**

1. University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign – Professional Computer Science
2. Northeastern – Computer Science
3. Cornell Tech - Computer Science - $10K Scholarship ⭐
4. University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign – Professional Computer Science

**Management**

2. Duke – MEMP – Engineering Management Program – $10K Scholarship

2. Rochester Institute of Technology – Human-Computer Interaction – $8,360 Scholarship

> What can I say? I like CS. 🤣

## Usage

Get inspired! 🎉

Personally, I still think both undergrad and grad school were completely unnecessary routes for me to take but I didn't want to regret it later so hey - c'est la vie! `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
