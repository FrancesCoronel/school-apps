# Essay 6

High school hadn't prepared me for this moment. Already drenched in sweat from walking for miles in the hot savannah, I was ready to abandon the lingering environmental lecture and set foot instead into my personal serenity circle back in my banda at the camp, the circle being complete only with its glorious serendipity and gleeful sluggishness. This perfect halo of relaxation existed only in my thoughts, though, and again I was thrown back into the reality of class finally starting in the middle of the open savannah where I was surrounded of having to write “Dung Lecture” on the top margin of my notepad.

I wasn't so much thrown off by the whole idea of the lecture as I was to the fact that I was actually there in the Lake Manyara area of Tanzania learning about different types of animal dung and still completely casual about the whole situation. Professor Kioko started picking up random lumps of dung and began comparing the physical structure of the various animal dropping types, noting ungulates produced pellet like scat and canine or feline like animals such as hyenas and lions excreted large tubular like droppings instead. I was horrified at myself in the inside for being able to digest all this information and carefully the differences between the types of animal droppings typically found in the national parks of Tanzania and around Lake Manyara. A few of my fellow college peers started murmuring “Ew...gross”, almost in unison.
