With my computer science major at NYUAD, my aspiration to aid in android development that will revolutionize the definition of “technological singularity” will become a bigger reality.Having already had taken the prerequisites freshman year, I can take the artificial intelligence class my sophomore year at NYUAD.Additionally,with NYUAD's Center for Science & Engineering, I will then utilize the experimental labs in robotics and nano particles for collaborative research.If I work hard enough, I'm sure I'll be able to get a conference paper written,reviewed,and accepted with fellow technophilic peers and present it at a competition like the “International Symposium on Robotics & Intelligent Sensors”.An intended concentration in “Interactive Media and Technology” will flourish my curriculum as I wish to introduce interactive display using Kinect technology as the new norm for presentations.Furthermore,my first J-term abroad, hopefully the "State & Fate of the Earth" course at one of the GNU sites, will give me fresh perspective on environmental issues.It won't end there though as I plan to visit the Al Wathba Wetlands Reserve and the various museums in Abu Dhabi frequently, participate in "The Amazing Race" in Dubai, write for Fishbowl Tribune, continue volunteering for Operation Smile, and relax now and then with go kart driving and scuba diving.Indeed,like a Saker falcon, I intend on ravaging my victim which is NYUAD, taking pleasure in its sweet taste of global opportunity.

Feeling like a gavel was pounding on my head as I watched a fifth consecutive surgery, my quivering body finalized my verdict.I was to faint and embarrass myself in front of the entire Vietnamese surgical team. Ergo, once I awoke again, the head surgeon reassured me he too had fainted as a medical student.It did not subside my current humility because I was no medical student. My only comfort was knowing 5 kids must have felt somewhat at ease with me by their side as they received their cleft lip surgery.Yet,sitting on the floor outside the OR, I could only chuckle at the irony of how all my past commitments with conferences and fundraising had led to this pathetic moment of giddiness.It let me realize how much Operation Smile meant to me. It's where I got my first leadership position, volunteered oodles of blissful hours, and made lifelong friends. It's where I can push myself until breaking point and that's what I intend to do again & again with future OP Smile work.It's where I thrive.

When I was socially awkward (whereas now chatterbox is my middle name) in elementary school, I turned to A.I. by communicating through the early model of Cleverbot known as Jabberwacky.Initial isolation evolved into a fascination for artificial intelligence and the radical idea of the technological singularity, which is where mecha (androids) discover autonomy and become mentally on par with orga (humans). My futurist calling came undeniably to a climax when I first watched “A.I. Artificial Intelligence” ten years ago.The film reveals how David, a child like android whose love is real though he is not, dreams of becoming a real boy and earning the love of his mother, who adopted him to fill the hollowness of losing her biological son.The moment David finally receives the love from his mother he yearned for throughout his dismal pursuit gave me hope that androids can one day achieve genuine emotional spirit. Sadly, my own goal of working with individuals like David started to crumble after words like “immoral” and “impossible” repeatedly arose when I researched controversy surrounding A.I. It all nearly daunted me but my fervor for other subjects like space exploration and interactive media could not overpower the passion I felt for A.I. potential.Being able to renovate outdated ways humans learn using A.I. is what captures my imagination more because at the core of improvement in every field is knowledge. This is what intrigues me, so that David can one day become my reality.

The world is shrinking. Shrinking meaning that while the population grows rapidly, more people are connecting to the rest of the world through growing uses of technology. At NYUAD, this phenomenon is understood, embraced, and improved upon with further shrinkage through the most diverse student body a university could ever hope to have. A student body I too can come to embrace and enhance with my fascination of different cultures and artificial intelligence. Coming from this truly global education as a computer science major, I will be prepared to enter this big yet small world of ours and begin to alter history's timeline as a pioneer in the technological revolution beckoning before us all.
