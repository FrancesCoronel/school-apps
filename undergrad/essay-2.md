# Essay 2

For Christmas 3 years ago, I asked for a microscope and a 13 organism dissecting set to toy with so I could quench my exponentially growing curiosity relating to biology. One day, I intend on applying my knowledge of biological research techniques in combination with advanced use of artificial intelligence in hopes of positively benefiting humanity.

By trying to attain this major goal, I have already tackled intellectual challenges. Before the age of 16, I have already taken 4 community college and university courses, scoring As/Bs in all of them. I have placed 1st for a science fair competition sponsored by Eastern Virginia Medical School through a study of cocaine and its effects on an international and scientific level.

Frankly, this thirst for knowledge has yet to be subsided.

Recently, I have discovered my specific passions in science lie in bioinformatics and immunology diseases and I feel I could learn so much more exposed to an environment given in this Roswell program. Not only would this program give me an opportunity to explore related fields in biology but I could also get a head start on individual/group collaborations inside laboratory settings and begin exposing presentations and papers on research topics I'm passionate about.

As hobbies, I enjoy working with video editing programs and volunteering with Operation Smile. I have worked with Adobe Premiere, Adobe After Effects, Photoshop, Final Cut Pro X, and iMovie and will also be attending a medical mission as a student educator through Operation Smile in Vietnam during early June. This mission met my standards for travel and learning combined in one as is essential to a great education.

As for periodicals I subscribe to/read regularly, I enjoy Virginian Pilot, Mac Life, NATIONAL WILDLIFE, and SIERRA.

I couldn't help myself last month and splurged on Dan Brown and Daniel Goleman, reading “Deception Point” by Dan Brown and “Emotional Intelligence” for the 3rd time by Daniel Goleman. These happen to be my 2 favorite authors for the time being , with Christopher Paolini placing third. As for January, I have unfortunately lacked in any extra reading aside from school related.
