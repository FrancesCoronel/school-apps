# Essay 5

Much of my time has been spent with Operation Smile, a worldwide children's charity organization that helps treat facial deformities. There's a five sided argument to my reasons behind my commitment: who, what, where, when, and why? It's who I can have a heart-to-heart with on child suffering. It's what inspired me to push myself until breaking point continuously, reveling in the joy I was able to bring to those less fortunate. It's where I got my first leadership positions, made lifelong friends, attended a influential training workshop, and fainted in front of an entire Vietnamese surgical team after watching 4 and 1/2 surgeries. It's when I can happily interact with generous multitudes of people that define the organization and share in the outlooks diversity can bring. It's why I was able to attend that 2 week long medical mission in Vietnam and why I didn't feel so guilty after fainting because I was aiding kids overcome anxiety in the OR. Really, Operation Smile is how I thrive!
